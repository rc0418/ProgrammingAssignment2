##makeCacheMatrix is a function allowing you to create and set a matrix as well as its inverse - stored as variable 'm'. 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmatrix <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getmatrix <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmatrix = setmatrix,
       getmatrix = getmatrix)
}
##cacheSolve inverts the matrix. If the inverse matrix is already available, it will be returned without the need of computation.
##If the inverse matrix is not found, it is computed and then returned.  
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmatrix()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setmatrix(m)
  m
}
